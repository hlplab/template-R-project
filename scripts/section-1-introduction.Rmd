# Introduction
How humans managed to survive so far remains one of the central questions of the social sciences. ... Here are some references [e.g., @bradlow-bent2008; @nygaard1994; @Perrachione2016; @sidaras2009; @wade2007; @weil2001a; @xie2021jep]. You can also make phonetic symbols, e.g., for the sound category [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("Êƒ")`] [as in *ship*, Newman et al., -@newman2001].

All data and code for this article can be downloaded from[https://osf.io/q7gjp/](OSF). This article is written in R markdown, allowing readers to replicate our analyses with the press of a button using freely available software [R, @R; @RStudio], while changing any of the parameters of our models. Readers can revisit any of the assumptions we make---for example, by substituting alternative models of linguistic representations. The supplementary information (SI, \@ref(sec:SI-software)) lists the software/libraries required to compile this document. Beyond our immediate goals here, we hope that this can be helpful to researchers who are interested in developing more informative experimental designs, and to facilitate the interpretation of existing results [see also @tan2021].
