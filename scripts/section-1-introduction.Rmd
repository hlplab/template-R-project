# Introduction
How humans managed to survive so far remains one of the central questions of the social sciences. ... Here are some references [e.g., @bradlow-bent2008; @nygaard1994; @Perrachione2016; @sidaras2009; @wade2007; @weil2001a; @xie2021jep]. And here is a figure references to Figure \@ref(fig:blub-results). When you look at the R-markdown, notice how the reference uses the label fig:label, whereas the caption and the R chunk that generates the figure use the label ref:label. Make sure to follow that format. 

(ref:blub-results) A VERBOSE CAPTION LIKE Illustrating the effects of $\lambda$ and $\pi$ on the posterior probability of .... **Top panel:** Differences in lapse rate $\lambda$ for a uniform bias of $\pi_{/d/}=.5$. As the lapse rate increases, the ceiling and flooring responses at the end points change while the categorization slope remains the same. **Bottom panel:** Differences in bias $\pi_{/d/}$ when the lapse rate $\lambda$ = .2. As the bias towards /d/ changes from 0.1 to 0.9, the categorization surface shifts upwards and to the right, resulting in more /d/ responses across the phonetic space. (THE ACTUAL FIGURE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS CAPTION AND IS JUST MEANT AS AN EXAMPLE)

```{r blub-results, fig.width = base.width * 4, fig.height= base.height + 1, fig.cap="(ref:blub-results)", warning=FALSE}
cars %>%
  mutate(z = rbinom(nrow(.), 1, .5)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(z ~ .)
```

You can also make phonetic symbols, e.g., for the sound category [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("Êƒ")`] [as in *ship*, Newman et al., -@newman2001]. And you can type equations like Equation \@ref(eq:posterior-probability-lapse), which describes Wichmann and Hill's psychometric model with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and more.  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:posterior-probability-lapse}
p(category | input) = (1 - \lambda) \frac{\mathcal{N}\!\left( input | \mu_c, \Sigma_c \right) \pi}{\Sigma_i \mathcal{N}\!\left( input | \mu_{c_i}, \Sigma_{c_i} \right) \pi_i} + \lambda \frac{\pi}{\Sigma_i \pi_i}
\end{equation}

All data and code for this article can be downloaded from[https://osf.io/q7gjp/](OSF). This article is written in R markdown, allowing readers to replicate our analyses with the press of a button using freely available software [R, @R; @RStudio], while changing any of the parameters of our models. Readers can revisit any of the assumptions we make---for example, by substituting alternative models of linguistic representations. The supplementary information (SI, \@ref(sec:SI-software)) lists the software/libraries required to compile this document. Beyond our immediate goals here, we hope that this can be helpful to researchers who are interested in developing more informative experimental designs, and to facilitate the interpretation of existing results [see also @tan2021].
